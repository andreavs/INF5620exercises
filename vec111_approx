We have V = Span{(1,0,0), (0,1,0)}, and our approximation will be 

u = c0(1,0,0) + c1(0,1,0) = (c0,c1,0).

It is trivial to see that the solution will be (1,1,0), but let us use the full Galerkin machinery. We have that


A = | 1, 0 |
    | 0, 1 |

as the basis vectors are orthonormal. The b-vector is 

b = | 1 |
    | 1 |

Which can be checked as <(1,0,0), (1,1,1)> = <(0,1,0), (1,1,1)> = 1. We want to solve

Ac = b, 

i.e. 

c = A^(-1)b = b.

so c0 = c1 = 1, as expected.

For a vector in the plane (a,b):

1) Associativity
	by elementwise addition and the fact that numbers are associative, u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w.

2) Commutativity
	once again, elementwise addition and the fact that numbers commute under addition. 

3) Identity element
	the element (0,0) has this property

4) Inverse element
	the inverse of (a,b) is (-a,-b)

5) distributivity 1
	as vectors have the property k(a,b) = (ka,kb), we have k(u+v) = k( (a,b) + (c,d) ) = k(a+c,b+d) = (ka+kc,kb+kd) = (ka,kb) + (kc,kd) = ku + kv

6) distributivity 2
	(k+h)*(a,b) = ( (k+h)a, (k+h)b ) = (ka + ha, kb + hb) = (ka,kb) + (ha,hb) = ku + hu

7) compatibility k(hu) = k(ha,hb) = k(h(a,b)) = (kh)*(a,b)

8) identity scalar
	1 has this property.


For functions on the form ax+b, the arguments are entirely similar.


For functions on the form 1 + ax^2 + bx, the sum of two such functions will be on the form 2 + cx^2 + dx, which is the wrong form.
